# hello the outline/glow may be wrong so if it is please help fix it with a pr 😁

# credits of people who made the old characters' custom character json

- RentaP (dev) - Samurai, Logan, Hailey, Cole (older), Farmer
- Willow - adjusted a lot of the jsons to be accurate

if i haven't credited a person for a character's json, i probably either got the json from the game, or created it myself

the """custom""" characters """i""" have made are free to use because idc at all lmao, just let me know if you use it or something i'm curious
